# SimpleMapKit-iOS-Mobile-Application
This app demonstrates how to use Mapkit to show locations and route in an iOS Mobile App.
This iOS app,provides the facility to enter two locations and view them on map. It also shows the route between the two locations. 
Few important features of the application are:
1. Showing proper placemark of the location as “Source” and “Destination”
2. Segues between view controllers to pass the location data.
